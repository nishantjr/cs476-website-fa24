Course Work, Policies and Procedures {#grading}
------------------------------------

Students taking the course will be expected to:

-   **Participate actively** and regularly in the course.
-   Present answers to **biweekly homework assignments** solved
    **individually**. Although student interaction and cooperation is
    encouraged, this **excludes** any communication on how to solve
    posted homework assignments, including the comprehensive one (see below).
    Communication on how to solve homework would constitute a
    serious violation of the honor code.
-   Present answers to a **midterm exam** at the classroom during the normal 
     lecture time (9:30 to 10:45) on Thursday October 17.  Students are encouraged
     to be at the classroom a few minutes before the exam, so that the exam
     can begin on time and they can have the full 75 minutes to write their answers.
-   A **comprehensive homework assignment** at the end of the course.
-   (if the course is taken for 4 units) Develop a **term project**,
    either individually or as part of a small group of students.

**Grading.**

-   The regularity in active participation will contribute 10% to the final grade.
-   Each problem on each  biweekly homework assignment will be worth 10 points, and
    the biweekly homeworks all together will be worth 50% of the grade.
-   Late homework will receive a 0%.
-   The midterm exam will be worth 20% of the grade.
-   The comprehensive homework assignment will be worth 20% of the grade.
-   There will be no final exam.
-   If you are taking the class for 4 credits, then there will also be a final
    project for the course. The final project must be turned in by the assigned
    final date before a grade for the class will be issued.

Homework
--------

When submitting homework please make sure:

1.  All attachments should start with `cs476-hwN-<netid>`.

    For example, `cs476-hw2-wuxytan7.pdf`, or `cs476-hw2-wuxytan7-nat-list.maude`.

    :::warning
    From HW2 onward, two points will be deducted if you do not use this format.
    It may be hard to find your assignment if you don't use this format.

    Make sure you use hypens and not underscores.
    :::

2.  Place your name and netid in the title or header of the PDF.
    This is to ensure that your homework doesn't get mixed up with someone else's.

Tools used
----------

### Maude and Maude tools

Maude will be the primary tool used in this course.  Several other
tools/libraries written in Maude will also be used.  Instructions
about them will appear at or before the time when they are
used in some lectures.

The current
version
is Maude 3.4.  Maude executables for both Linux and Mac OS  can
be downloaded from the github release page
and installed as per instructions at [the Maude wiki](https://maude.cs.illinois.edu/wiki/Maude_download_and_installation).

#### Instructions for usage on EWS (Maude 3.1)

The EWS machines have an older version of glibc, so we must use Maude 3.1
instead of the latest available version.
Below are instructions to download and install that version.

```
$ wget http://maude.cs.illinois.edu/w/images/3/38/Maude-3.1-linux.zip
$ unzip Maude-3.1-linux.zip
$ cd maude-3.1/
$ ./maude.linux64
./maude.linux64: /lib64/libtinfo.so.5: no version information available (required by ./maude.linux64)
